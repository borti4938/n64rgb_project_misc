Miscellaneous PCBs for the N64RGB Project
---

This repository contains several PCBs which I find to be helpful for the N64RGB project.
Here is a small overview.

- [Filter AddOn](./FilterAddOn/): A tiny PCB which adds a video filter to the MultiOut for the analog output
- [Flex PCB N64RGB to MultiOut](./N64RGB2MoutFilter/): A flexible PCB which connects between N64RGBv2.1 or N64Advanced and MultiOut. This flexible is designed to have the filter add on included if wanted.
- [Power Regulator](./PowerReg/): A power regulator connecting to 12V power rail and outputting 3.3V for older N64RGB PCBs (earlier than v2.1) and viletims commercial N64RGB product.
- [Flex PCB RCP-NUS to N64RGB](./RCP2N64RGB/): A flexible PCB which connects between RCP-NUS and N64RGBv2.1 or N64Advanced.
- [Flex PCB RCP-NUS to some wire pads](./RCP2Pads/): A tiny flexible PCB which connects to the RCP-NUS optimized for price. This helps installing a CPLD-/FPGA-based N64RGB PCB with wires to the digital video lines.
- [A simple N64RGB Amp](./simpleRGBamp/): A THS7374 board mostly suitable for a N64 which already outputs RGB (-CPU-01 to -CPU-04 boards).
