RCP2N64RGB
---

A **flexible** PCB which connects the RCP-NUS (graphical processor of the N64) with the [N64 Advanced PCB](https://github.com/borti4938/n64adv_pcb) or [N64RGB PCB](https://github.com/borti4938/n64rgb_pcb).
The connection PCB must be soldered on both ends - one end goes to the RCP-NUS, the other to the modding board.
To support older PCBs, I decided to go with the solder solution.
I future updates I may replace that and go with a FFC connector on the modding board side.

### Ordering the PCB

You can order the PCB from any manufacturer you like.
OSHPark flex service is fine, also the flex service from PCBWay does a great job.


### Assembly

Order the PCB and source the components as requested by the [BOM sheet](./doc/RCP2N64RGB_BOM.xlsx).
Assembly should be straight forward.
The ferrite bead / resistor arrays don't have an orientation.

You may print the [assembly sheet](./doc/rcp2n64rgb_assembly_sheet_top.pdf) for your orientation.
If you use a PCBA service, you may use the provided [mounting file](./doc/rcp2n64rgb.mnt).

### Installation

Please read the installation guide of the [N64 Advanced PCB](https://github.com/borti4938/n64adv_pcb) or [N64RGB PCB](https://github.com/borti4938/n64rgb_pcb).
